# Diagnostics & Legacy Scripts

---

**Deprecation Notice:**

- All legacy scripts and outputs are deprecated and retired. For all registry, flatmap, and room registry generation, use the canonical generator scripts in `scripts/generators/`.
- `omega_registry_master.json` is the only canonical registry output. All validation, analytics, diagnostics, audits, and post-processing scripts must operate on this file only.
- Legacy outputs and scripts are retained here for audit trail and historical reference only.
- See `scripts/generators/README.md` for canonical pipeline documentation.
