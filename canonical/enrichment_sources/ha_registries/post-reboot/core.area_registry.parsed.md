# Home Assistant core.area_registry ‚Äî Configuration Analysis Summary

## Schema Observed

Each area object includes:
 ‚Ä¢ id: Unique area identifier (used in registry bindings)
 ‚Ä¢ name: Display name
 ‚Ä¢ floor_id: Semantic or spatial grouping identifier (optional)
 ‚Ä¢ icon: Optional icon (visual grouping)
 ‚Ä¢ aliases: Alternate names for UI or logic referencing
 ‚Ä¢ humidity_entity_id / temperature_entity_id: Optional sensor anchors (currently null)
 ‚Ä¢ created_at, modified_at: Metadata timestamps

‚∏ª

## Observed Area Classification

üõè Physical Rooms (User-Oriented)

These represent actual, sensorized or inhabitant-facing rooms.

Area id Name Floor ID
bedroom Bedroom bedroom_evert
kitchen Kitchen null
living_room Living Room null
ensuite Ensuite bedroom_evert
laundry laundry downstairs
laundry_room Laundry room null
wardrobe Wardrobe bedroom_evert
desk Desk bedroom_evert
hallway Hallway null

üß† These are primary rooms for alpha/omega occupancy, presence, and comfort sensor grouping.

‚∏ª

## Floor Groupings (floor_id)

Defines logical tiers for area hierarchy:

Floor ID Associated Area(s)
bedroom_evert Bedroom, Ensuite, Desk, Wardrobe
downstairs Downstairs, Laundry
upstairs Upstairs
network Home Assistant
hestia Network & Connectivity, Home, System Admin, HA Addons, NAS, Virtual

üß± These floor_ids act as semantic or architectural clusters for composite grouping, not strictly geometric floors.

‚∏ª

## Abstract / Virtual Zones

These abstract groupings are non-physical, intended to isolate:
 ‚Ä¢ system-level sensors
 ‚Ä¢ integrations
 ‚Ä¢ diagnostics

Area id Purpose
network_connectivity Monitors cloud/integration states
system_admin Logic-level administration zones
ha_addons Addon states, update sensors
virtual Non-physical automations or proxies
nas Synology/server hardware
home_assistant Internal system probes
home Possibly umbrella ‚Äúglobal home‚Äù
apple_matuvu Named virtual/unknown grouping
evert Reserved placeholder or persona area

üß† These will NOT generate alpha-tier occupancy/presence groups but may produce virtual diagnostics or inference outputs.

‚∏ª

## CONFIG LAYOUT: KEY FINDINGS

üîπ 1. Mixed Semantic Layers
 ‚Ä¢ Physical vs logical zones coexist (e.g., bedroom vs virtual)
 ‚Ä¢ System-level zones are declared with hestia or network as floor_id

üîπ 2. Floor ID Acts as Tier Linker
 ‚Ä¢ Allows grouping of related spaces (e.g., all bedroom_evert areas)
 ‚Ä¢ May influence how shared presence/comfort signals are fused

üîπ 3. No Duplication of Rooms
 ‚Ä¢ Each id is unique and not repeated across aliases
 ‚Ä¢ Aliases used for hallway labeling only

üîπ 4. Area Granularity is High
 ‚Ä¢ desk, wardrobe, and ensuite are distinct even within bedroom
 ‚Ä¢ This allows precision-scoped presence logic (e.g., wardrobe_presence_omega)

‚∏ª

## Phase 3 Implications: Alpha Sensor Registry

 ‚Ä¢ Primary Alpha Groups should only be created for physical/inhabited areas
 ‚Ä¢ Clustered sensor logic must prefer floor_id when no explicit room match is found
 ‚Ä¢ Abstract zones may serve as targets for system_occupancy, network_status, or meta_diagnostics groups ‚Äî but must not conflict with physical alpha sensor groups

## Summary of Canonical Room Anchors for Œ±-Tier Logic

Area ID Use for Alpha Grouping? Notes
bedroom ‚úÖ Yes Core sleep/occupancy logic
ensuite ‚úÖ Yes Bathroom sensors
desk ‚úÖ Yes Desk-specific presence logic
wardrobe ‚úÖ Yes Often low-signal area
kitchen ‚úÖ Yes Core motion/temp zone
living_room ‚úÖ Yes Comfort and entertainment
laundry ‚úÖ Yes Standalone occupancy zone
laundry_room ‚úÖ Yes (if active) May be duplicate or fallback
hallway ‚úÖ Yes Transitional presence only
upstairs ‚ö†Ô∏è Only for eta-tier Aggregation tier
home, network_connectivity, virtual ‚ùå Abstract/system-tier only
